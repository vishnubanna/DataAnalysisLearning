## Final Project 

# Dataset :: Path 2 -> Student Video Watching Behavior

# Relavent Folders 
    - The folder named data-sets/ contains the behavior-performance.txt dataset and 3 csv files containing data that 
      we tried to extrapolate. 
        - Behavioral_cumulative_calc.csv is a file containing the cumulative correct qustions answer up the the 
          current video for each student and the cumulative number of videos they watched up to a certain point. 
          
            - so if all videos were watched, at video 3 cumulative will be 2 videos watched so far excluding the current
             video

        - Behavioral_Shift_S_cumulative.csv is the same as above but it also contains a colomn for the value of s on the
         previous video. This was used to try and do a one offset prediction on for problem 3. 

        - sumarized.csv contains the sumarized data for each student. So the average for each data point, as well as the
         total number of videos each student watched
    - the Folder Report\ Images/ contains all the images that were generated by the program

# Original Data Set 
    - The data set contains 29304 data points with 3976 unique students
    - the colomuns include  'userID', 'VidID', 'fracSpent', 'fracComp', 'fracPlayed', 'fracPaused', 'numPauses', 'avgPBR', 'stdPBR', 'numRWs', 'numFFs','s' 

# Running Analysis Programs
    1) install all packages
        > pip3 install --user -r requirements.txt 
    
    2) Problem 1
        - get required plots 
            > python3 problem_1.py 
        - get reduced dimension visualization 
            > python3 find_k.py 
    
    3) Problem 2
        > python3 problem_2.py 
    
    4) Problem 3
        > python3 problem_3.py 

# Analysis 
    - All analysis can be found in report.pdf
    - The Main Analysis found in this report shoes how student video watching behavior realtes to their performance in an 
        online course
